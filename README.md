## Project Status
Project is: In Progress


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- Front end Design still needs more work
- Greater integration with Google Places for the venue database. i.e. Pull pictures and information from Google Places to use in the web app.
- Personally, I need to spend more time planning out my projects before getting started on coding.

To do:
- Implement a match feature in Night Outs where if two or users on a night out select a venue, the venue is highlighted and added to a sublist.
- Date and time implementation for Nights Out.
- Implement a friends feature so that a user can't add all users to a night out.
- Venues have categories which can be used to filter Favourites and Night Outs.
